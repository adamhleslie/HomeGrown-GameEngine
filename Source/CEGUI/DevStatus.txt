implementing CEGUI module

/**
	To create a brand new module:
		0. Create a new folder for it, and add it to CMakeLists.txt with add_project_module
		1. Inherit from this class
		2. Implement constructor and destructor
			a. Call disable() within your constructor if you don't want your module to update upon load
		3. Increase Core::kNumModules (Core.h)
		4. Add your module to Core::loadModules() (Core.cpp)
		5. Add functionality as needed - GameObjects and Components not yet implemented
**/

notes: not sure if we need to create the .cpp and .h files, do these already exist?
also, not sure how to construct such that CEGUI hooks in with the renderer
