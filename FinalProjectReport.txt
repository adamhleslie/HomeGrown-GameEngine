We did worse in almost every area imaginable.  Our final game is a product of running out of time, and is very different from our original plan.  Given another week, we could probably convert it into our original design.

We ran into some bugs that held us up for a few days.  Mainly:
1.) We got an infinite loop in our OIS code that was difficult to debug, as it would freeze the machine.  

2.) Once we got most of our project build, we had an issue were our paddle would not respond to input (but we could get our ball to respond, which was very confusing).
3.) Our design for the game structure will scale very well for project three, but in retrospect was difficult to take on for this project.  It was difficult for everyone to understand the overall structure as well.

I don't know that we would have done anything differently, as I think we are well positioned for the next project.
